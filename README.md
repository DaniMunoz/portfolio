# Daniel's Portfolio

Hi, this is Daniel, welcome to my portfolio!

These are the most relevant projects that I have worked on as a Software Developer.

I am willing to add more to the list :)

## About this project

For now, it uses:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- Test Driven Development: [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The data and images, at this moment, are local

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```
